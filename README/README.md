# README Generator

## Purpose:
- I wanted to make an app that would write a professional readme, so I can save time when creating projects.

## Instructions for Use:
- To use, one must have node.js installed on their machine, and make sure you have the proper node_modules installed as well. 
- Open the project in your command line, and type "node index.js".
- Answer the prompts.
- When the prompts are completed, a professional readme is created and added to the same project folder.
